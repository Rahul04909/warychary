    <section id="our-story">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>WaryChary Care began with a simple observation: despite progress in product technology, many Indian women still compromise between comfort, safety, and environmental responsibility. Our founders — a small team of healthcare practitioners, product designers, and sustainability advocates — set out to build a different kind of menstrual brand. One that offers premium performance without harsh chemicals, and one that gives back to the communities we serve.</p>

      <p>We listened to months of real conversations: mothers who wanted gentle products for their daughters, young professionals seeking discreet and premium protection, and rural women demanding affordable dignity. Those conversations became the foundation of WaryChary Care — a brand shaped by empathy and engineered with modern materials science.</p>

      <h3>Key components</h3>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li><strong>Organic-touch top sheet:</strong> soft, dermatologically assessed for sensitive skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Absorbent core:</strong> engineered fibers that absorb quickly and lock fluid to prevent leaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Leak barriers & wings:</strong> anatomically placed for a secure fit and discreet profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Breathable back sheet:</strong> provides discreet protection while promoting airflow.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="sustainability">
      <h2>Sustainability — Our Planet Promise</h2>

        <li>We actively explore reusable and hybrid product lines for the future while keeping disposability safe and responsible today.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Waste & education</h3>
      <p class="muted">Proper disposal of sanitary products is a major challenge. WaryChary Care runs awareness drives because sustainable solutions must be practical and culturally sensitive. We partner with local organizations to educate about safe disposal and menstrual hygiene management.</p>
